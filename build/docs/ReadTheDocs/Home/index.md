# ModuleBuild

Modulebuild is a scaffolding framework which can be used to kickstart a generic PowerShell module project. It includes the base files and scripts required to perform regular build releases, uploading to the powershell gallery, and other such fun. All the hard work is done with the excellent invoke-build project engine, a rather large set of build tasks for it, and a custom Plaster template.
