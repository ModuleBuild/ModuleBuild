# Step 6 - Start Your Next Release

To start working on your next release (or roll back to a prior release) you will need to update the version of your module. This is easily done:

`.\Build.ps1 -UpdateRelease -NewVersion '0.0.5'`

Once this has been done you can proceed to build your module again:

`.\Build.ps1`
