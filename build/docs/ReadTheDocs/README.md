## ReadTheDocs Manifest Creation
Each folder in this path (ReadTheDocs) becomes its own subsection within the generated ReadTheDocs YML manifest file. This only covers the base folder and all the *.md files within it (so no subfolders will be recognized).

**NOTE** Every public function you have in this module will automatically be included in the ReadTheDocs manifest file under a 'Function' section. As such you do not need to specify a 'Function' folder (as it will be automatically generated by PlatyPS and referenced by the ReadTheDocs manifest file creation process).
